        <h1>🖥️ Welcome to the ACM GitHub! 🖥️</h1>
        <h2>❓ Who are we? ❓</h2>
        <p>The <b>Association for Computing Machinery</b> is the Worlds Largest Scientific and Educational Computing Society!</p>
        <p>We are one of the few ACM Student Chapters based in Wisconsin, with an active community of people with an interest in computing!</p>
        <h2>🤝 How can we benefit you? 🤝</h2>
        <p>We promote learning in any field related to computing, such as Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, and Information Technology.</p>
        <p>We have one of the largest communities of like-minded majors within the College of Letters and Sciences!</p>
        <p>Here are some things we do at the Club:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Weekly Meetings</b>: These will cover a topic of interest, sometimes having a hands-on section to practice new skills!</li>
                <li><b>Industry Speakers</b>: Learn from experienced speakers about jobs in computing, how to stand out, and what it's like!</li> 
                <li><b>Large Scale Events</b>: We host and help out with many large events, ranging from the UWW Hackathon to the Programming Competition!</li>
                <li><b>Project Nights</b>: Want to show off your skills? Maybe you learned something cool? You can show these off at our new Project Nights!</li>
            </ul>
        <p>We are a relatively new club on the UW-W campus, so expect even more events and activities in the future!</p>
