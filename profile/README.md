    <h1>Welcome to the ACM GitHub!</h1>
    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
    <p>The <b>Association of Computing Machinery</b> is the Worlds Largest Scientific and Educational Computing Society!</p>
    <p>We are one of the few ACM Student Chapters based in Wisconsin, with an active community of people with an interest in Computing!</p>
    <h2>How can we benefit you?</h2>
    <p>We promote the learning in any field relating to Computing, such as Computer Science, Cybersecurity, Data Science, and Information Technology.</p>
    <p>We have one of the largest communities of likeminded majors within the College of Letters and Sciences!</p>
    <ul>Here are some things we do at the Club!
        <li><b>Weekly Meetings</b>: These will cover a topic of interest, sometimes having a hands-on section to practice learning new skills!</li>
        <li><b>Large Scale Events</b>: We host and help out with many large events, ranging from the UWW Hackathon, to the Programming Competition!</li>
        <li><b>Project Nights</b>: Want to show off your skills? Maybe you learned something cool? You can show these off at our new Project Nights!</li>
    </ul>
